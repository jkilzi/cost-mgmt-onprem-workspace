# Workspace overview

This repository is a **Cost Management** meta-workspace: the Karpathy wiki, per-submodule constitutions, checkout copies under `submodules/`, and the Cursor harness (`.cursor/rules`, `.cursor/skills`, `.cursor/plans`).

## Wiki role

The wiki is the **compounding layer**: durable, cross-cutting knowledge that should not be re-derived every session. Submodule upstream truth lives in `submodules/<name>/`. The wiki links and summarizes what matters **across** those boundaries.

## Jira without a public repo

Research and status live in **`wiki/entities/`** and Jira comments. **Jira comments that only list file paths are not enough** for most readers. See **[Jira handoff when this workspace is not published](jira-handoff-without-public-repo.md)** for the recommended pattern (self-contained Jira text + carry-forward into the implementation ticket; optional attachments).

**Issue links:** To replace **Blocks** with **Related** (or any type change), Jira has no in-place edit — use **`jira issue unlink`** then **`jira issue link`** — see **[Jira CLI: change issue link type](jira-cli-issue-links.md)**.

**Public sharing:** Redact personal Quay, Demo Catalog, and workshop cluster URLs before publishing; see **[Public repo hygiene](public-repo-hygiene.md)**.
